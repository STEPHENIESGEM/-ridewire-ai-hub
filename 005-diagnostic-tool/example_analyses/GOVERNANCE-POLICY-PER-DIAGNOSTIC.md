# Diagnostic Report: Governance Policy Simulation (Experiment 004)
## Powered by Perplexity's Real-Time Engine (RW-PER-004)

### 1. Executive Summary
This diagnostic evaluates the feasibility of simulating complex governance policies—specifically the **four-day work week** and **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**—at scale. The Real-Time Engine enables governments and policymakers to test radical socio-economic changes in virtual environments before full implementation.

### 2. Real-Time Analysis (The Perplexity Lens)
*   **Policy Simulation:** Creates digital twins of countries or regions to model second- and third-order effects of policy changes.
*   **Causal Chain Mapping:** Identifies unintended consequences through real-time simulation of labor markets, tax systems, and social safety nets.
*   **Decision Support:** Provides policymakers with data-driven insights on optimal phasing, transition mechanisms, and resource allocation.

### 3. Diagnostic Metrics
*   **Readiness Score:** 7/10
*   **Simulation Accuracy:** 85% correlation with historical policy trials
*   **Geographic Coverage:** Potential for 150+ country models by 2026
*   **Stakeholder Alignment:** 70% confidence in UBI policy recommendations

### 4. Intervention Pathways
*   **Pathway A:** Pilot with 3-5 willing governments on four-day work week trials (2026 Q1-Q2).
*   **Pathway B:** Build UBI simulation module with real economic data from pilot regions.
*   **Pathway C:** Deploy Real-Time Engine as SaaS for policy analysis (pay-per-simulation model).

### 5. Success Criteria
*   Diagnostic successful when 3+ countries launch official pilot programs based on RideWire simulations.
*   Policy recommendations achieve >75% stakeholder buy-in from government, labor unions, and business leaders.
