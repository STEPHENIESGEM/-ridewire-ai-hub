# Diagnostic Report: Climate Direct Air Capture (Experiment 002)
## Powered by Gemini's Quantum Leap Framework (RW-GEM-002)

### 1. Executive Summary
This diagnostic addresses the economic and technical barriers to scaling Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology. The goal is a "Quantum Leap" in cost reduction and energy efficiency to make carbon removal commercially viable.

### 2. Quantum Leap Analysis (The Gemini Lens)
*   **Rugged Fitness Landscape:** Current DAC is stuck at high costs ($1,400/ton). The framework identifies leverage points in sorbent chemistry and waste heat utilization.
*   **Technological Convergence:** Integrates breakthroughs in **room-temperature superconductivity** and **nuclear fusion** to provide the low-cost, high-density energy required for massive-scale DAC.
*   **Economic Disruption:** Aims for a 10x reduction in capture costs through AI-optimized plant design and real-time atmospheric modeling.

### 3. Diagnostic Metrics
*   **Readiness Score:** 8/10
*   **Target Cost:** <$100/ton of CO2
*   **Energy Intensity:** 40% reduction through heat recovery
*   **Scalability Index:** High (Modular plant architecture)

### 4. Intervention Pathways
*   **Pathway A:** Simulation of next-generation metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 adsorption.
*   **Pathway B:** Small-scale pilot integrating small modular reactors (SMRs) with DAC units.
*   **Pathway C:** Development of a global "Carbon HUD" for real-time removal tracking.

### 5. Success Criteria
*   Diagnostic successful when a simulated 1Mton/year plant achieves a net-negative energy balance.
*   Validation of the 58:1 LTV:CAC ratio in the climate tech sector.
