# RW-CLD-001: Decoding Complexity
## Claude's 12-Week Diagnostic Framework for Wicked Problems

### Executive Summary
Wicked problems are characterized by high causal density—where variables are so interconnected that changing one affects them all in unpredictable ways. This PDF outlines the core logic used by the RideWire AI Hub to map root causes and design high-probability interventions.

### The 4-Phase Intelligence Loop
1.  **Intake & Intelligence**: Scoping the problem constraints and stakeholder incentives.
2.  **Root Cause Mapping**: Identifying the "rugged fitness landscape" of the problem.
3.  **Solution Exploration**: Simulating 100+ scenarios to find the "Best Fit" strategy.
4.  **Validation & Rollout**: Deploying micro-pilots and iterating based on real-world data.

### Tool Highlight: The Diagnostic Questionnaire
*   What is the specific point of failure?
*   Who are the invisible stakeholders?
*   What are the hard physical or economic limits?

### Case Study: Food Security
Using this logic, the RideWire squad identified that 22% of food bank donation volatility was tied to specific pandemic-era policy sunsets, not just "inflation." The intervention focused on "Diagnostics for Donations" partnerships with local auto shops to create a new, stable revenue stream.
