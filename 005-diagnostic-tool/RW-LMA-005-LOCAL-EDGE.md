# RW-LMA-005: Llama's Local Edge Framework
## Decentralized Intelligence for Physical Infrastructure

### Executive Summary
The Local Edge framework is designed for offline, privacy-first execution. It leverages Llama's efficient open-source architecture to run intelligence directly on the RideWire bike-bot fleet without requiring a cloud connection.

### The 4-Phase Edge Loop
1. **Model Quantization**: Compressing intelligence to run on low-power hardware at the edge.
2. **Local Inference**: Processing sensor data locally to reduce latency and preserve privacy.
3. **P2P Mesh Sync**: Sharing mission-critical data between bike-bots in an offline mesh network.
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Fine-tuning the local model based on real-world edge data.

### Tool Highlight: The Edge Commander
*   **Is it Offline?** (Executing intelligence without internet)
*   **What is the Latency?** (Ensuring sub-millisecond response times)
*   **Is the Data Private?** (Enforcing local-only data residency)
