# RW-GEM-002: Gemini's Quantum Leap Framework
## Scaling Multimodal Intelligence for the RideWire AI Hub

### Executive Summary
The Quantum Leap framework is designed for exponential scaling using Gemini's multimodal reasoning. It focuses on the bridge between digital intelligence and physical infrastructure.

### The 4-Phase Speed Loop
1. **Multimodal Scan**: Processing visual, audio, and sensor data from the bike-bot fleet.
2. **Context Window Expansion**: Mapping long-term dependencies in the wicked problem landscape.
3. **Simulated Iteration**: Running 1000+ virtual tests per second to find the "Quantum Path."
4. **Instant Deployment**: Pushing code updates to the edge via the RideWire Hub.

### Tool Highlight: The Multimodal Sensor Kit
*   How do we see the world? (Visual data)
*   How do we hear the world? (Acoustic diagnostics)
*   How do we feel the world? (Haptic feedback loops)
