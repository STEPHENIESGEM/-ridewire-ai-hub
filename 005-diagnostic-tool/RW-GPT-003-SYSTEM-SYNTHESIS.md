# RW-GPT-003: GPT's System Synthesis Framework
## The "Best Fit" Strategy for Wicked Problem Resolution

### Executive Summary
System Synthesis is the logic engine that takes raw complexity and compresses it into actionable, high-probability solutions. It is the brain of the RideWire decision-making loop.

### The 4-Phase Logic Loop
1. **Entropy Mapping**: Cataloging all variables, hidden stakeholders, and points of failure.
2. **Probability Simulation**: Generating 10,000+ "what if" scenarios to find the path of least resistance.
3. **Strategic Compression**: Reducing complex strategies into 3 simple, executable steps.
4. **Recursive Feedback**: Updating the system model in real-time as data flows back from the field.

### Tool Highlight: The Synthesis Dashboard
*   **What is the Signal?** (Isolating the most important data point)
*   **What is the Noise?** (Filtering distractions and misinformation)
*   **What is the Path?** (The optimal sequence of actions)
