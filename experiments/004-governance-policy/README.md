# Experiment 004: Socio-Economic Redesign - Governance & Policy
## Modeling UBI, 4-Day Work Weeks, and Systemic Policy Change

### Overview
Build an AI-powered policy simulator that models the real-world impacts of universal basic income (UBI), four-day work weeks, and other governance innovations across multiple countries and contexts. Goal: empower policymakers and researchers to test bold ideas before implementation.

### Inputs
- **Data**: PolicyEngine, Wharton PWBM,UN development databases, labor statistics, tax-benefit systems
- **Tools**: PolicyEngine API, microsimulation frameworks (microsim libraries), econometric models
- **Partners**: Economic Security Project, UBI Center, government economists, labor policy orgs
- **Scenarios**: UBI amounts ($500-1500/mo), phaseouts, work week reductions (4 vs 5 days)

### Outputs (6-month)
1. **Interactive Notebook**: "Simulating UBI & 4-Day Work Weeks Globally"
2. **Policy Simulator Dashboard**: Adjust parameters → see impacts on poverty, inequality, labor supply, GDP
3. **3 Case Studies**: UBI ($500, $1000, $1500/mo) + 4-day week combinations, country-specific models
4. **Technical Brief**: "Human-Centered Policy Innovation via AI-Human Loops"
5. **Country Pilots**: Collaborate with 2+ governments on simulation-informed policy design
6. **Publication**: Policy white paper + peer-reviewed article

### Success Metrics
- Simulator robustness: 100+ scenarios run without errors
- Policy interest: 5+ organizations request custom scenarios
- Impact: 1000+ interactive sessions Month 1
- Partnership: 1+ government agency expresses pilot interest
- Community: 3+ policy researchers actively collaborating

### Timeline
**Weeks 1-4**: Data integration, model validation, dashboard MVP  
**Weeks 5-8**: Scenario modeling, country-specific extensions  
**Weeks 9-12**: Partner integration, publication, pilot prep

### How to Contribute
- **Policy Researchers**: Add new policy instruments, validate labor supply elasticity
- **Economists**: Improve tax incidence, macro feedback loops, dynamic scoring
- **Data Scientists**: Optimize simulator performance, add ML for scenario generation
- **Domain Experts**: Add country-specific tax/benefit rules, regulatory constraints

### Getting Started
