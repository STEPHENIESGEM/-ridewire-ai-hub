## VIRALITY MECHANICS

### The "Hook-Prove-Ask" Framework
**Applied to Every Video**:
1. **Hook** (First 3 seconds): Make bold claim
   - "This AI built an entire system in 3 days"
   - "Humans lost to AI in 6 categories"
   - "We violated 5 startup "rules""

2. **Prove** (Next 10-30 sec): Show evidence
   - GitHub repo commits
   - Timeline comparisons
   - Real results
   - Code examples

3. **Ask** (Last 5 sec): Drive action
   - "Subscribe for part 2"
   - "GitHub link in bio"
   - "Join the Discord"
   - "Comment your biggest blocker"

### Trending Format Integration
**Monthly Trending Analysis** (Every Sunday):
- Check YouTube Trends tab
- Identify format trends (split-screens, transitions, music)
- Adapt 2-3 trending formats to RideWire narrative
- Example: "5 things I didn't know about AI chains" (trending format)

### Algorithm Optimization
**Key Signals YouTube Ranks**:
1. Click-through rate (CTR): Target 8-12% for Shorts
2. Average view duration: 50%+ of video length
3. Subscriber growth rate: Accelerating trend
4. Watch time (total): Compound growth week-over-week
5. Engagement: Comments, likes, shares

**Weekly Optimization**:

- Tuesday: Identify what worked (hook style, topic, timing)
- Wed-Fri: Apply learnings to new uploads
- Saturday: Implement changes in long-form
