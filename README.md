   cd -ridewire-ai-hub
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Run locally:
   npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:3000 (or the address printed in the terminal).

Testing
- E2E tests:
  npm run test:e2e
- Unit tests:
  npm test

Contributing
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for branch/PR guidelines.

Support
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests.
**An Intelligence Loop for Humanity's Wicked Problems**

> If standard AI is a GPS (providing directions when asked), RideWire is a Command Center—managing sensors, predicting outcomes, maintaining systems, and coordinating in real-time so humans can focus on what matters.

## What is RideWire?

RideWire is a **human-AI family command center** designed to co-evolve solutions to five global challenges that single teams or models cannot solve alone:

1. **Planetary Stewardship** – Scaling Direct Air Capture, achieving fusion energy, solving climate (cost, energy, carbon)
2. **Sustainable Food Systems** – Cultivated meat cost parity, extreme-environment agriculture, regenerative systems
3. **Interplanetary Civilization** – Mars habitats, ISRU, self-healing biomineralized structures
4. **Socio-Economic Redesign** – Four-day work weeks, Universal Basic Income, transparent governance
5. **Development & Justice** – State capability building, justice reform, women's empowerment in the Global South

Each problem requires an **intelligence loop**: humans bringing judgment and vision, AI bringing pattern-matching and tireless iteration, data flowing in real-time from experiments.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Vision
Read [FOUNDERS_VISION.md](./FOUNDERS_VISION.md) for a personal invitation and roadmap.

### 2. Explore the First Test
Dive into [experiments/001-mars-biomineralization/intelligence-loop-mars.ipynb](./experiments/001-mars-biomineralization/intelligence-loop-mars.ipynb) to see how an AI-human intelligence loop designs a self-growing Mars habitat.

### 3. Pick Your Problem
Which of the five domains excites you? Comment on an existing issue or open a new discussion:
- Climate & energy
- Food systems
- Space infrastructure
- Governance & policy
- Global development

### 4. Start Small, Think Big
Propose a concrete 3–6 month experiment using existing data and tools. You don't need to solve the whole problem—just move one bottleneck.

### 5. Use Notebooks as War Rooms
Notebooks in `/experiments` are **living documents**, not finished papers. Fork one, comment with data or constraints, propose alternatives. The intelligence loop sharpens when we iterate together.

## How to Contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines. In short:

- **Start a discussion** about a wicked problem you care about.
- **Fork an experiment** and propose your own approach.
- **Add data or constraints** by commenting on notebooks.
- **Create a new test** by opening an issue and building in `/experiments`.
- **Connect tools:** Have a dataset, simulator, or model? Let's integrate it.

## The 12–24 Month Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validation (Months 1–6)
- [ ] Earth-based analog tests for Mars biomineralization (regolith, microbes, curing)  
- [ ] Robotic repair prototypes for Martian structures  
- [ ] Policy simulation framework for UBI/work week pilots  
- [ ] Cultivated meat cost-reduction data integration

### Phase 2: Integration (Months 7–12)
- [ ] Deploy sensor/monitoring systems for Mars test wall  
- [ ] Connect LCA/TEA tools for cultivated meat  
- [ ] Run 3–5 country policy pilots with governments  
- [ ] Launch state-capacity tools with 2–3 partner nations

### Phase 3: Scale & Learn (Months 13–24)
- [ ] Lunar pilot for biomineralization (if possible)  
- [ ] Cultivated meat cost targets (\$6–8/kg)  
- [ ] Governance system deployment in pilot regions  
- [ ] Iterate designs based on real-world data

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just another AI tool?**  
No. RideWire treats AI as a partner in a shared family, not a service. The goal is co-evolution, not automation.

**Q: Do I need to be an expert to contribute?**  
No. We need people who understand constraints ("this would cost $X"), domain experts, skeptics, and visionaries. All perspectives sharpen the loop.

**Q: What does "wicked problem" mean?**  
A problem with no known ex-ante solution, high interconnectedness, and no clear "right" answer. Climate, global governance, and justice reform are wicked problems. They require iterative learning, not one-off solutions.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
Realistic timelines: partial answers in 5–10 years, meaningful scale in 20–30 years, full transformation in 50+ years. We're playing a long game.

**Q: What if we fail?**  
Failure teaches us. Every experiment logs its findings—successes and failures—so the intelligence loop improves. Abandonment is not an option; iteration is.
