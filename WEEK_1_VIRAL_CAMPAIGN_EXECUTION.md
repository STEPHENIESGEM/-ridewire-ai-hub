## HANDOFF FOR WEEK 2

Once Week 1 closes:
1. Document what worked (metrics winning, post formats, timing)
2. Identify which use case resonated most
3. Plan Week 2 **30-day product narrative** expansion
4. Recruit top 5 contributors as brand ambassadors
5. Prepare for potential investor/press outreach

---

## KEY MINDSET

**"Movement over perfection. Velocity over polish."**

Week 1 is about **proving the market exists**, not building the perfect product. Every metric win unlocks Week 2's bigger plays.

**The chain prompting methodology is the product.** RideWire is just the proof. Sell the methodology, not the tool.
